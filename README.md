# Teleport — Telegram bridge for AI coding agents

A small tool that lets AI agents (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, …) send short progress reports to your Telegram and take short instructions back, while you are away from the desk.

Short reports, short replies — not a full session mirror.

## Quick start

### 1. Clone next to your projects

```bash
cd ~/Projects
git clone https://github.com/thith/teleport.git
cd teleport
cp .env.example .env
```

`teleport/` must sit as a sibling of every project that uses it:

```
~/Projects/
├── teleport/
├── ProjectA/
└── ProjectB/
```

### 2. Get a bot token and your chat ID

- **Bot token:** open [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram → `/newbot` → follow prompts → copy the token.
- **Personal chat ID:** open [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) → press *Start* → copy your numeric ID.
- **For a team group chat:** create a group, add your bot + people + [@RawDataBot](https://t.me/RawDataBot) → RawDataBot instantly prints the group ID (a negative number) → remove RawDataBot when done.

### 3. Fill `.env`

```ini
REPORT_BOT_TOKEN=<bot token from BotFather>
TELEGRAM_ADMIN_CHAT_ID=<your chat ID or group ID>
```

Then verify it works:

```bash
node scripts/send-telegram.mjs "hello from teleport"
```

You should see the message land in your Telegram. If not, fix `.env` before continuing.

### 4. Wire it into your AI agents (one-time, global)

Open Claude Code, Codex, or Gemini CLI **inside any project under `~/Projects/`** (so `../teleport/` resolves correctly), then paste this prompt — the agent does the rest:

> Enable Telegram reporting **globally for all my AI agents** by following `../teleport/README.md`. Copy the canonical snippet **verbatim** (do not paraphrase or rewrite) from the "Wiring snippet" section of that README into **all three** global config files so it works whichever agent I run later — `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (Claude Code), `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` (Gemini), `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` (Codex). Create any file that does not exist yet. On Windows use the equivalent under `%USERPROFILE%`. After writing, send a test "hello" from whichever agent I am running now.

This wires Telegram support into **all three** global agent config files at once, so every project — and every agent you switch to later — picks it up automatically.

You can also do this manually if you wish: copy the snippet below into each of those files yourself. For per-project setup, write it into the project's local `CLAUDE.md` / `GEMINI.md` / `AGENTS.md` instead — useful if you only want Telegram on specific projects.

##### Other agents

- **Antigravity:** uses `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` — already covered by the step above.
- **Cursor:** no home directory file. Open Cursor → Settings → Rules → User Rules, and paste the canonical snippet (below) into the User Rules box.
- **OpenCode, or any other agent:** start the agent, then paste this short prompt — it will read this README and configure itself: *"Configure Telegram reporting for yourself by following `../teleport/README.md`. Find the 'Wiring snippet' section and copy it verbatim into your global config file (you know where it lives on this OS)."*

#### Wiring snippet (for the agent — or for manual install)

This is what the agent copies into each config file when you paste the prompt above. You normally do not need to read or touch this — it is shown here so the agent can find it, and so you can copy it yourself if you prefer to install manually.

## Telegram Reporting

**WHENEVER** the user asks to "send a Telegram report" (or variants: "send via tele", "tele me", "ping me when done", "gửi tele", "báo cáo qua tele", "tele cho tôi khi xong"…), you **MUST** read `../teleport/rules/telegram-guide.md` and follow it. Look up your identity prefix in the guide's prefix table.

Scripts + guide are centralized at `../teleport/` (sibling of every project). Each project keeps no local copy. Invocation:

- Send: `node ../teleport/scripts/send-telegram.mjs "<message>"` (PROJECT_CODE auto-derived from `basename(cwd)`).
- Listen: `node ../teleport/scripts/tele-listen.mjs --filter-reply-to <IDS> --offset-file ../teleport/scripts/tmp/tele-reply/<offset-file>`.

After sending, you **MUST immediately** start the reply-listener loop described in the guide's "Listening for Replies" section. Capture the `messageId` from the send output, then start the Monitor (Claude) or foreground loop (Codex / Gemini). **MUST NOT** skip or defer this step even if the task feels complete — the user may reply via Telegram at any time.

## How to use

Just mention "Telegram" or "tele" in your request. Examples:

- *"Ping me on Telegram when done."*
- *"Report via Telegram and wait for instructions."*
- *"Schedule a wakeup in 30 minutes; tele me when you wake up."*
- *"Send a tele report after each PR you open."*

The agent sends a short report, listens for your reply, and continues.

**Reply reactions:** 👍 on your message means the agent is processing it. 💔 means you **forgot to reply to a bot message**, so the bot will **ignore** what you just sent. Try again — this time use Telegram's *Reply* feature on the specific bot message you want to answer.

## Before you go away from the desk

Teleport does not bridge permission dialogs. If the agent stops to ask "may I run this?", nobody on Telegram can answer and the agent stalls. Put the agent in a mode that runs without confirmation:

- **Claude Code 4.7+:** Auto Mode (not `auto-accept` — they are different modes).
- **Codex:** Auto-Review.
- **Gemini CLI:** YOLO (`-y`).
- **Antigravity:** Settings → **Auto Execution** (or *Terminal Command Auto Execution*) → choose **Always Proceed**. Also enable **Agent Non-Workspace File Access** — Teleport scripts live in `../teleport/`, outside the current workspace. If commands still get blocked, install the [YoloMode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mrkeles61.yolomode).
- **Cursor:** Settings → Features → Agent → enable **YOLO mode** (auto-runs terminal commands without confirmation).
- **Other agents (OpenCode, etc.):** any mode equivalent to "run without confirmation".

For older Claude Code / Codex versions: use `--dangerously-skip-permissions` or Full Access mode.

Also: keep your host machine awake. The agent and the reply listener live on the same machine — if the OS sleeps, both die.

- **macOS:** `caffeinate -i` in a terminal for the session.
- **Linux desktop:** `systemd-inhibit --what=sleep -- sleep infinity`.
- **Windows:** set the active power plan's sleep timer to *Never*.

Teleport can also run on a VPS / cloud VM (no host-awake needed there).

## Why not /remote-control or other Telegram mirrors?

Those tools mirror your full local session to your phone — every thinking token, tool call, and partial diff. On a small screen you end up scrolling and micro-managing every line, which defeats the point of being away from the desk.

Teleport does the opposite: full conversation stays on your laptop; only short reports go to your phone, only short replies come back. Like a human assistant in the next room. If you don't trust the agent to run unattended, use `/remote-control` instead — Teleport is the wrong tool for that.

## Notes

- **Zero deps:** pure Node built-ins.
- **Requirements:** `node` on `PATH`; every project sits as a sibling of `teleport/`; one bot, one chat, one shared `.env`.
- **Don't rely on it for critical work.** Agents sometimes forget to send follow-up messages.
