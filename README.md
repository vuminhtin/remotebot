# Teleport — Telegram reporting for AI agents

Centralized Telegram bot scripts shared across multiple projects on the same machine. Replaces per-project copies of `scripts/send-telegram.mjs` + `scripts/tele-listen.mjs` to avoid race conditions when several projects use the same bot.

## Why centralize

When multiple projects on the same machine share one bot token but each holds its own script + cache, concurrent monitor processes call Telegram's `getUpdates` independently and "steal" each other's replies. Centralizing one cache, one poll lock, and one global offset eliminates that race.

## Layout

```
~/Projects/teleport/
├── .env                  ← REPORT_BOT_TOKEN + TELEGRAM_ADMIN_CHAT_IDS (shared by all projects)
├── rules/
│   └── telegram-guide.md ← canonical guide every agent reads
├── scripts/
│   ├── send-telegram.mjs
│   ├── tele-listen.mjs
│   └── tmp/tele-reply/   ← shared cache + lock + offset (gitignored)
└── README.md
```

## Path convention

All paths use `../teleport/...`, relative to the *calling project root*. Convention: every project lives as a sibling of `teleport/`:

```
~/Projects/
├── teleport/
├── ProjectA/
├── ProjectB/
└── <other-project>/
```

Agents always invoke with `cwd = project root` and refer to `../teleport/...`. There are no hardcoded absolute paths anywhere.

## Usage

```bash
# Send (from project root, e.g. ~/Projects/ProjectA/)
node ../teleport/scripts/send-telegram.mjs "<message>"

# Listen (from project root)
node ../teleport/scripts/tele-listen.mjs \
  --filter-reply-to <messageIDs> \
  --offset-file ../teleport/scripts/tmp/tele-reply/<offset-file>
```

`PROJECT_CODE` (the `[XXX]` prefix on every message) is auto-derived from `basename(process.cwd())`. Override with `TELE_PROJECT_CODE=...` env var if needed.

## Onboarding a new project (the one-liner)

Tell your AI agent (Claude, Codex, Gemini, etc.) inside the new project:

> Enable Telegram reporting for this project by following `../teleport/README.md` — add the wiring snippet to my agent context file (CLAUDE.md / GEMINI.md / AGENTS.md), then test it once.

That single instruction is enough. The agent will (a) read this README, (b) paste the snippet from the next section into the right context file, and (c) send a "hello" message to confirm the wiring.

## Wiring it into a project

Add the snippet below to your project's `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, or `AGENTS.md` — any file the agent reads at startup. Paste it verbatim; no edits required.

## Telegram Reporting

**WHENEVER** the user asks to "send a Telegram report" (variants: "send tele", "send via tele", "ping me when done"…), you **MUST** read `../teleport/rules/telegram-guide.md` and follow it. Identity prefix for this agent is `<emoji> *Claude on <topic>:*` (see guide for emoji and topic rules).

Scripts + guide are centralized at `../teleport/` (sibling of every project). This project keeps no local copy. Invocation:

- Send: `node ../teleport/scripts/send-telegram.mjs "<message>"` (PROJECT_CODE auto-derived from `basename(cwd)`).
- Listen: `node ../teleport/scripts/tele-listen.mjs --filter-reply-to <IDS> --offset-file ../teleport/scripts/tmp/tele-reply/<offset-file>`.
- Cache + lock + audit log live in `../teleport/scripts/tmp/tele-reply/` (shared across all projects using the same bot).

After sending, you **MUST immediately** start the reply-listener loop described in the guide's "Listening for Replies" section. Capture the `messageId` from the send output, then start the Monitor. **MUST NOT** skip this step even if the task feels complete — the user may reply via Telegram at any time.
````

(Adapt the identity prefix wording — `Claude reports`, `Codex reports`, `Gemini reports` — to whichever agent is reading the file.)

## First-time setup on a new machine

```bash
cd ~/Projects
git clone <teleport-repo-url> teleport
cd teleport
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env: fill in REPORT_BOT_TOKEN and TELEGRAM_ADMIN_CHAT_IDS
```

No `npm install`, no `npm link`, no symlink, no shell config required.

## Multiple recipients

`TELEGRAM_ADMIN_CHAT_IDS` is treated as a **single chat ID**. If you want several people to receive the reports, create a Telegram group, add the bot + all the people to the group, and use the **group's chat ID** here. The bot will post once into the group and everyone sees it. This avoids the complexity (and message-tracking bugs) of fan-out to N individual chats.

## Requirements

- `node` on `PATH` (the scripts use Node's built-in fetch, fs, etc. — no dependencies).
- Every project that uses Teleport must sit as a sibling of `teleport/`.
- One Telegram bot, one chat (single user or a group), one shared `.env`.
