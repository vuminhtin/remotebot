# Telegram Reporting Guide

> **Path convention:** all paths in this guide are relative to the *calling project root*. Convention: `teleport/` is a sibling folder of every project (e.g. `~/Projects/ProjectA/`, `~/Projects/teleport/`, `~/Projects/ProjectB/`). Agents always invoke with `cwd = project root` and refer to `../teleport/...`. No hardcoded absolute paths anywhere.

Use `node ../teleport/scripts/send-telegram.mjs` (centralized — same script for all projects on this machine) to send messages or files to admins listed in `../teleport/.env`. PROJECT_CODE prefix is auto-derived from `basename(cwd)` so the agent gets the right `[PROJECT]` tag without per-project config.

## When to use
- After finishing a task while the user is away from the keyboard.
- When the user needs an actual file (spec, RFC, log) — send as attachment.

## Content style: short task list

Report on the phone screen, not in a console. Keep it tight.

- **Format: task checklist.** One line per item, GitHub-style:
  ```
  ✅ done item
  ✅ another done item
  ⬜ not done / skipped item
  ```
- **Target: under 320 chars** (soft limit — overshoot is fine when needed). Don't list every diff or paste logs.
- **Identity prefix — lookup table (centralized here so context files don't have to duplicate):**

  | Agent | Prefix |
  |---|---|
  | Claude | `<emoji> *Claude on <topic>:*` |
  | Codex | `*Codex here:*` |
  | Gemini | `*Gemini here:*` |
  | Other | `<emoji> *<Agent> on <topic>:*` (use the Claude-style by default) |

  - `<topic>` = short summary of the task, **max 9 words**.
  - `<emoji>` = a random emoji picked once per conversation thread (see "Thread emoji" below). Codex / Gemini currently do not use an emoji — keep their existing minimal form unless the user asks otherwise.
  - **Language:** Match the user's language for this conversation. Default to English if unset. Keep one language for the entire thread (do not mix languages in the same thread). The wording in the prefix table (`on <topic>`) is the English form — substitute the equivalent phrasing in the chosen language.
- **Thread emoji:** On your **first** Telegram send in a conversation, pick a random emoji unrelated to the topic (randomness reduces collisions between concurrent conversations). Use the **same emoji** for all subsequent messages in that thread (replies, follow-ups).
- **Project code:** The script auto-prefixes `[CODE]` derived from `basename(process.cwd())`. Override with the `TELE_PROJECT_CODE` env var if needed. Agents do NOT need to add this manually.

Example (with project code `ProjectA`):
```
[ProjectA] 🦊 *Claude on telegram loop isolation:*
✅ split telegram-guide
✅ add task-list convention
⬜ migrate AGENTS.md (next session)
```

## How to send

**Default — inline:**
```bash
node ../teleport/scripts/send-telegram.mjs "🦊 *Claude on loop fix:*
✅ task 1
✅ task 2
⬜ task 3"
```
Multi-line works inside `"..."` as long as the content has no `"` / `$` / `` ` `` / `\` (task lists rarely do).

**Switch to file (heredoc + pipe, or `--file`) only when:**
1. Content > ~320 chars and won't naturally trim.
2. Inline send failed (markdown parse reject, shell-quote bug).
3. The payload is genuinely a file (spec, RFC, log) — then use `--file` instead.
4. The user explicitly asks to send a file ("send the spec", "attach the log", …) — use `--file`.

```bash
mkdir -p ./tmp
cat > ./tmp/report.md <<'EOF'
🦊 *Claude on loop fix:*
…long content…
EOF
cat ./tmp/report.md | node ../teleport/scripts/send-telegram.mjs
```

**Attachments (actual files):**
```bash
node ../teleport/scripts/send-telegram.mjs --file <path> "caption (optional)"
```

## Markdown
Write naturally. The script auto-escapes MarkdownV2 special chars (see `escapeMarkdownV2` in the script for the full set) while preserving `*bold*`, `_italic_`, `` `code` ``, `[label](url)`, and fenced code blocks.

## Long messages (>4000 chars)
The script auto-sends as a single `.md` file attachment with the first line as caption — it does NOT split into multiple Telegram messages. This keeps the reply model simple: one send always produces one messageId, so admin replies to that single message always match the listener's filter. Log shows `(long-message → .md file)`.

## Failure handling
- **Non-zero exit:** network/auth failure → MUST report the failure to the user. Do not silently treat it as sent.
- **Markdown reject:** the script auto-falls-back by sending the content as a `.md` attachment with the first line of the message as caption (so the admin sees the thread emoji + agent identity). Log shows `(markdown-parse-error → .md file)`. No retry needed.

## Reliability features

### Sent Registry
Every successful `node ../teleport/scripts/send-telegram.mjs` call auto-appends `{messageId, chatId, ts}` to `../teleport/scripts/tmp/tele-reply/sent-registry.jsonl`. This provides a persistent record of ALL bot messages — no reliance on LLM memory for IDS tracking.

### Local Update Cache
`tele-listen` no longer calls Telegram's `getUpdates` directly per-loop. Instead:
1. Acquires a file lock (`poll.lock`) — only one process polls at a time.
2. Fetches from Telegram API, partitions orphans (reacted with 💔 outside lock), appends non-orphan updates to `updates-cache.jsonl`.
3. Releases lock. Each loop then filters from the local cache using its own per-loop offset.

This eliminates **offset stomping** — previously, concurrent loops calling `getUpdates` with different offsets caused Telegram to discard updates meant for other loops.

**New-loop initialization (post-fix):** When a loop runs for the first time (per-loop offset file missing), it inherits `min(oldest cached update_id, globalOffset)` rather than `globalOffset` alone. Otherwise, if loop A has already fetched updates B's filter cares about and advanced `globalOffset` past them, a freshly-starting B would init too high and miss those still-buffered updates. Cache pruning (last 500 updates) keeps this bounded.

### Auto-react 👍
When `tele-listen` finds a message to process, it immediately reacts with 👍 via `setMessageReaction`. The admin sees instant acknowledgment without waiting for the agent to finish processing.

### Orphan Auto-react 💔
During the centralized fetch, orphan messages (admin messages with no reply target) are automatically reacted with 💔 and excluded from the cache. Agents never see orphans — no reasoning required. Admin must reply to a specific bot message to reach the owning agent's loop.

### Isolation
Each loop only processes **direct matches** — replies to messages in its `--filter-reply-to` IDS. Stale replies (replies to messages from other agents/conversations) are ignored. This prevents cross-agent contamination without relying on agent reasoning.

### Auto-supersede
**Primary motivation:** safety net for **Claude with the Monitor tool**, where the agent can start a new Monitor while a previous one is still running — that's the setup that produces orphan listeners in practice. Codex / Gemini / other agents using the foreground-loop pattern can't hit this in the normal flow (their loop blocks the tool call), but the mechanism also applies to any background-launched listener loop (e.g. a developer running `until tele-listen ... ; do sleep 12; done &` from a shell).

Every `tele-listen` invocation registers `{pid, filter, offsetFile, startedAt, startTime}` (pid = the long-lived bash wrapper, i.e. `process.ppid`; startTime = the wrapper's `ps lstart` snapshot, used to detect PID reuse) into `listener-registry.jsonl` under a `registry.lock`. Before polling, it checks the registry: if **another live listener has a strict-superset filter**, the current listener exits cleanly so its outer `until …; do sleep N; done` wrapper also exits.

Why "strict superset": when a conversation moves to a new Monitor, the agent always appends new messageIds — the new filter is a strict superset of the old. So an older listener detects a newer one and self-exits within one to two poll cycles (~12s for Monitor, ~5s for foreground); the second cycle only matters if the newer listener loses its first registry-lock race, which is rare.

**Cross-conversation safety is by convention, not construction.** Each agent must only put bot-sent messageIds it itself sent into `--filter-reply-to`. Two such IDS sets are disjoint (each bot-sent messageId belongs to exactly one conversation), so strict-superset can only match intra-conversation. If an agent ever invokes `tele-listen` **without** `--filter-reply-to` (catch-all / debug run), it would have no filter constraint — to prevent it from wiping every legitimate filtered listener, the supersede check treats catch-all (`filter == null`) as **neither superseding nor being superseded by** anything. So a catch-all listener runs in parallel, harmlessly, and a filtered listener is never killed by an unintended catch-all.

**This does NOT remove the agent's obligation to TaskStop the previous Monitor.** TaskStop ends the harness-level task immediately; auto-supersede is a safety net for the case where the agent forgets (catches up within one poll cycle). Belt and suspenders.

**Failure modes this does NOT cover:**
- If the agent calls `TaskStop` *without* starting a new Monitor, the OS-level bash wrapper keeps spinning (TaskStop does not SIGTERM children). With no newer listener to detect, supersede never fires.
- If the new Monitor's filter is **identical** (not a strict superset) to the previous one — e.g. the agent re-triggers a Monitor without sending a new message first — neither is a strict superset of the other, so neither self-exits and they coexist until TaskStop.

Mitigation for both: either start a new Monitor with a broader filter (the canonical flow already does this), or kill the wrapper specifically with `pkill -f "until.*tele-listen"` (matches the wrapper bash, not just node). A future change may add an idle-timeout exit.

## Listening for Replies (MUST follow after every successful send)

After every successful `node ../teleport/scripts/send-telegram.mjs` send, you **MUST** start a loop that polls for admin replies. Do not stop the loop just because the original request was only to send a message; stop only when a direct reply arrives, the user explicitly says not to wait, or the user interrupts the turn.

### Step 1 — Capture the messageId

The send command always prints a single messageId in its output, regardless of length:
```
[send-telegram] sent to 123456789 (messageId: 5821)
```
Extract `N`. This is your first tracked ID.

If text exceeds Telegram's per-message text limit (4096 chars; script triggers at 4000 to leave MarkdownV2 escape headroom), the script auto-falls-back to sending the content as a single `.md` file attachment with the first line as caption. You'll see:
```
[send-telegram] sent to 123456789 (long-message → .md file, messageId: 5821)
```
Still **one messageId** — chunking has been removed in favor of file delivery to keep the reply-tracking model simple (one send = one ID = one reply target).

**State to track** (held in agent memory — no prompt template needed):
- `IDS` = comma-separated list of ALL messageIds you have sent in this conversation (grows as you respond)
- `FIRST` = the very first messageId (used for the offset file — stays constant)
- `LAST` = the most recently sent messageId (last element of IDS)
- `E` = thread emoji

### Step 2 — Start the reply listener

The way you listen depends on your agent capabilities:

**For Claude (Using Monitor Tool):**

> **🚨🚨🚨 ONE CONVERSATION = ONE MONITOR. ALWAYS. 🚨🚨🚨**
>
> Every send-telegram requires starting a fresh Monitor with the updated IDS. If a previous Monitor is still running, you **MUST `TaskStop` it FIRST**. Two Monitors in the same conversation is a **silent data-loss bug**, not just a tidiness issue.
>
> **How the silent loss happens (observed in production):**
> 1. You sent message A. Monitor X is running with IDS that includes A. You then send message B without stopping X. You start Monitor Y with IDS that includes B (and A).
> 2. Both X and Y share the same `--offset-file`.
> 3. Admin replies to message B. The update is fetched and cached.
> 4. Monitor X polls. Its filter doesn't include B → no match → but it STILL calls `advanceLoopOffset`, which moves the shared offset file past the update.
> 5. Monitor Y polls next. Its filter would match B, but it reads cache from the now-advanced offset → the update is invisible. **Lost forever.**
>
> Both Monitors think they did the right thing; the script does the right thing. The bug is the agent running two listeners against the same offset file. There is no script-side fix — only the agent can prevent this by always TaskStopping before starting a new Monitor.
>
> **Failure mode tell:** the admin replies to your latest message, you never see a notification, and the offset file is at a value > the update_id of the admin's reply (check `fetch-audit.jsonl` — the update is `classification: cached` but no prompt file was written).

**Canonical pattern (use this EVERY send, no exceptions):**

Track `LAST_MONITOR_ID` across the conversation (the task ID returned by your most recent `Monitor()` call; empty before the first send).

```bash
# Step A — if you have a previous Monitor from this conversation, stop it:
TaskStop(task_id: {LAST_MONITOR_ID})   # skip on the very first send

# Step B — start the new Monitor with updated IDS:
Monitor({
  command: "until node ../teleport/scripts/tele-listen.mjs --filter-reply-to {IDS} --offset-file ../teleport/scripts/tmp/tele-reply/{FIRST}-offset.txt; do sleep 12; done",
  timeout_ms: 300000,
  persistent: true,
  description: "Telegram reply to messageId {LAST}"
})
# → save the returned task ID as the new LAST_MONITOR_ID for the next cycle
```

**Self-check before EVERY `Monitor()` call:** "Did I `TaskStop` the previous Monitor in this turn?" If you can't recall starting one, you're on the first send and can skip. Otherwise, `TaskStop` it now — don't start two.

The Monitor runs at zero AI cost in the background and notifies you when the `until` loop exits successfully.

**For Codex / Gemini / other agents (Using Foreground Loop):**
Run the polling loop synchronously in the foreground after every successful send. Assume the user is AFK and keep the command running until it exits with a matching reply. Do not replace this with a short poll, a timeout, or an early stop unless the user explicitly says not to wait or interrupts the turn.
```bash
run_shell_command({
  command: "until node ../teleport/scripts/tele-listen.mjs --filter-reply-to {IDS} --offset-file ../teleport/scripts/tmp/tele-reply/{FIRST}-offset.txt; do sleep 5; done"
})
```
The terminal will block until a reply is received. When a reply arrives, the command exits 0 and immediately returns the prompt file path in stdout.

### Step 3 — Handle the notification

When the loop succeeds, its output contains `prompt written to <path>`. Parse that file as JSON, then delete it.

Process the request, then reply via: `node ../teleport/scripts/send-telegram.mjs --reply-to <prompt.messageId> "E <response summary>"`. Capture new messageId M, append M to IDS.

**Note:** Only direct replies (to a message in your IDS) will reach your loop. Orphans are auto-reacted with 💔 at fetch level and never cached. Stale replies (to other agents' messages) are silently ignored. No agent reasoning needed for message routing.

**After handling — restart the listener (this is a loop):**
1. Restart with the updated IDS (now including the messageId M you just sent):
   - **Claude:** apply the canonical pattern in step 2 — `TaskStop` the previous Monitor, then start a new `Monitor()`. Never have two Monitors live in the same conversation.
   - **Codex / Gemini / other agents:** start a new foreground loop with the updated IDS (the previous foreground loop has already exited when it caught the reply, so there's nothing to stop — just relaunch).
2. The cycle repeats: Poll → reply arrives → process → respond → restart listener.

The prompt file path changes as IDS grows (it includes the filter key), so always extract the path from the notification rather than hardcoding it.

### Notes
- **Local cache prevents offset stomping**: all loops read from `updates-cache.jsonl`, only one process calls `getUpdates` at a time via file lock.
- **Sent registry** (`sent-registry.jsonl`): persistent record of all bot messages.
- **Auto-react 👍**: admin sees instant ack when message is picked up, before processing completes.
- **Orphan auto-react 💔**: orphan messages (no reply target) are reacted with 💔 and excluded from cache at fetch time. Agents never see them.
- **IDS grows monotonically**: every message you send gets appended. `--filter-reply-to IDS` matches replies to ANY of them — admin can reply to any message in the thread.
- **Strict isolation**: each loop only processes direct replies to its IDS. No orphan fallback, no stale reply capture. Cross-agent contamination is impossible at the script level.
- **Duplicate safety (partial)**: if a Monitor fires *while* the previous prompt file still exists, `tele-listen` skips (it sees the file and exits). But the script does not maintain a "processed update_id" ledger, so an update that was already consumed, replied to, and had its prompt file deleted *can* surface again if the per-loop offset is rewound (e.g. new-loop init re-reading shared cache, or manual offset-file deletion). Agents should be defensive: if you receive a notification for a reply that looks like one you already handled, double-check before re-replying.

## Rare flags
- `--raw` — skip auto-escape (caller already escaped MarkdownV2).
- `--plain` — plain text, no markdown parsing (for noisy logs/stdout).
- `--reply-to <messageId>` — send as a Telegram reply to a specific message (used when responding to an admin reply in the loop).
- `--react <messageId>` — react with 👍 to a specific message (used for manual ack).
