# Telegram Reporting Guide

> **Paths:** `teleport/` is a sibling of every project. Agents normally invoke with `cwd = project root` and refer to `../teleport/...`. Before running any Teleport script, verify the shell working directory: if you are not at the project root, either set `workdir` to the project root first or adjust the relative path to the actual `teleport/scripts/...` location. Do not use absolute paths in reusable instructions.

`node ../teleport/scripts/send-telegram.mjs` sends messages/files to admins in `../teleport/.env`. `[PROJECT]` prefix auto-derived from `basename(cwd)` (override via `TELE_PROJECT_CODE`).

## When to use
- Finished a task while user is away.
- User asks for a file (spec/RFC/log) → use `--file`.

## Content format

```
[Project] <emoji> *<Agent> on <topic>:*

✅ done

✅ another done

⬜ skipped
```

- **One blank line between items.** MarkdownV2 treats single `\n` as soft break (one wrapped paragraph) — `\n\n` for hard break. For noisy logs use `--plain` (Telegram skips parsing, every `\n` is a break).
- **Target < 320 chars.** Don't paste diffs/logs.
- **Agent:** `Claude` / `Codex` / `Gemini CLI` / `Antigravity` / `Cursor` / `<Other>`.
- **Emoji:** random per-thread (collision-avoidance for concurrent convos). Pick once on first send; reuse for the lifetime of the thread. All agents must include one.
- **Topic:** ≤ 9 words.
- **Language:** match user's language; keep consistent in the thread. The "on" wording is the English form — translate.

## How to send

Inline (default):
```bash
node ../teleport/scripts/send-telegram.mjs "🦊 *Claude on loop fix:*

✅ task 1

✅ task 2"
```

Heredoc / pipe (when inline shell-quoting is fragile):
```bash
cat > ./tmp/report.md <<'EOF'
🦊 *Claude on loop fix:*
…
EOF
cat ./tmp/report.md | node ../teleport/scripts/send-telegram.mjs
```

Attachment:
```bash
node ../teleport/scripts/send-telegram.mjs --file <path> "caption"
```

**Auto fallbacks:**
- Message > 4000 chars → sent as one `.md` file (never split into multiple messages).
- MarkdownV2 parse reject → resent as `.md` attachment with first line as caption.

**Failure:** non-zero exit → report failure to user; do not assume sent.

## Convo identity

To stay in the same thread, the agent must associate messages under a single conversation (`convoId`):

1. **First send:** Send the message. Capture the convo ID from the stdout: `[send-telegram] convo: <N> messageId: <M>`.
2. **Subsequent sends:** Always pass `--convo <convoId>` and `--reply-to <prompt.messageId>` (where `prompt` is the incoming user message JSON parsed from `tele-listen`) to stay in the same convo and visually reply to the user's message.

Send stdout ends with:
```
[send-telegram] sent to <chatId> (messageId: <M>)
[send-telegram] convo: <N> messageId: <M> pid: <P>
```

Capture `<N>` once; pass to the listener as `--convo <N>`.

## Listening for replies (MUST after every successful send)

Two cases. `send-telegram.mjs` prints the matching hint on stdout.

**Claude (Monitor tool):** one-shot tele-listen inside an `until` loop. Monitor restarts it after each reply.
```
TaskStop(task_id: <LAST_MONITOR_ID>)   # skip on first send

Monitor({
  command: "until node ../teleport/scripts/tele-listen.mjs --convo $CONVO_ID; do sleep 12; done",
  timeout_ms: 300000,
  persistent: true,
  description: "Telegram reply to convo <CONVO_ID>"
})
```

**Other agents choose by shell behavior:**

Interactive streaming shells (like Codex) can keep a foreground watcher open:
```bash
node ../teleport/scripts/tele-listen.mjs --watch --convo $CONVO_ID
```
The supervisor loops internally: poll → write `prompt-convo-<N>.json` → wait until the file is deleted (= agent consumed) → resume. Keep this command session open; do not rely on shell backgrounding with `&`, because some tool wrappers detach or reap background jobs silently. Stop it with Ctrl-C when the conversation is done. If you accidentally backgrounded it, stop it with `pkill -f "tele-listen.*--watch.*--convo ${CONVO_ID}( |$)"`.

Buffered shells that return output only after command exit (like Gemini CLI) should wait for one prompt at a time:
```bash
node ../teleport/scripts/tele-listen.mjs --wait-once --convo $CONVO_ID
```
`--wait-once` polls internally until exactly one matching prompt is ready, prints the prompt path, then exits so the agent can read and handle it. Run it again after deleting the prompt if you need to keep listening.

After starting `--watch` or `--wait-once`:
- Do NOT end your turn / send a "final" or similar response while waiting for replies (most agent runtimes stop polling once the turn ends).
- Capture the convoId from `[send-telegram] convo: <N>` stdout: `export CONVO_ID=<N>`.
- Keep the turn active until the command prints `prompt written to .../prompt-convo-$CONVO_ID.json` or `prompt ready: .../prompt-convo-$CONVO_ID.json`, then read+reply+delete.
- Loop: when prompt appears → read JSON → reply via send-telegram → delete the prompt file → loop. For `--wait-once`, re-run the same `--wait-once` command to wait for the next reply.
- End the turn ONLY when the user explicitly requests to stop (e.g., "close connection", "end turn", "stop loop").
- If the user says something ambiguous like "done", "ok", or "bye", DO NOT end the turn. Instead, ask for explicit confirmation (e.g., "Should I wait for further instructions, or are we finished here?") and wait for a clear confirmation before ending the turn.

When the loop / daemon writes `prompt written to <path>`, parse that file as JSON:
- `text`, `messageId`, `chatId`, `replyToMessageId`, `replyToText`, `quotedText`, `convoId`, `attachments[]`.

Reply:
```bash
node ../teleport/scripts/send-telegram.mjs --reply-to <prompt.messageId> --convo $CONVO_ID "..."
```

Then delete the prompt JSON. Restart the listener (same command).

**Attachments:** `attachments[].localPath` (if non-null) → file under `tmp/tele-reply/attachments/<botId>/<updateId>/`. After processing, delete each referenced `<botId>/<updateId>/` dir. Entries with `error` (`exceeds_20mb`, `download_failed`) have `localPath: null`.

**Two Monitors per convo = silent loss bug.** Always `TaskStop` the previous before starting a new one. Auto-supersede is a safety net but not a substitute.


## Flags

**send-telegram.mjs:**
- `--convo <N>` — the ID of the conversation thread.
- `--reply-to <messageId>` — the Telegram message ID to reply to.
- `--file <path>` — send a file as a document.
- `--plain` — send as plain text without Markdown parsing.
- `--raw` — send pre-escaped MarkdownV2 text.
- `--react <messageId>` — react 👍 to a message.

**tele-listen.mjs:**
- `--convo <N>` — the conversation thread ID to listen to.
- `--watch` — start a long-running foreground supervisor (ideal for streaming shells like Codex).
- `--wait-once` — poll until exactly one new reply is ready, then exit (ideal for buffered shells).

## Troubleshooting

- `convo <N> has no registered messages …`: Run the repair command printed in the error message to restore the local session registry:
  ```bash
  node ../teleport/scripts/import-convo.mjs --convo <N> --bot <id>
  ```
